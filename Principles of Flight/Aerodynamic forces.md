[[PoF]]
Aerodynamic force is a force generated by contact with air. There are three of them: Lift, [[Drag]] and Thrust. Main formula for them is 
$$F=\frac{C_f * \rho * V^2 * S}{2}$$

#### Total reaction

Total reaction is sum of lift and [[Drag]] vectors. Outcome point of total reaction is [[Center of pressure]]

Total reaction = Lift + Drag vectors
