Cambered Aerofoinls also known as Asymetric Aerofoils. Aerofoils with different curves on the upper and lower surfaces.

#### Mean Camber Line
An imagenary line half-way (equidistant) between the upper and lower surfaces of the aerofoil.

#### Thickness chord ratio (Fineness ratio)
Ration of the aerofoil's maximum thickness to the length of it's chord. Also known as T/C ratio, measures in percentage. Small T/C for high speed, Big T/C for low speed.


## Non-symmetrical aerofoil
