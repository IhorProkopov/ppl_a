### Wing twist (washout)
**Washout** is a characteristic of aircraft wingdesign which deliberately reduces the lift distribution across the span of an aircraft’s wing. The wing is designed so that the angle of attack is greater at the wing roots and decreases across the span, becoming lowest at the wing tip. This is usually to ensure that at [[Stall]] speed the wing root stalls before the wing tips,  providing the aircraft with continued aileron control and some resistance to spinning. Washout may also be used to modify the spanwise lift distribution to reduce [[Induced Drag]]
