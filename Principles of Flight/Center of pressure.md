[[PoF]]

## Center of pressure
Center of Pressure The center of pressure is the point where the total sum of a pressure field acts on a body. In aerospace, this isÂ **the point on the airfoil (or wing) where the resultant vector (of lift and drag) acts**.

#### CoP for cambered airfoils
It moves forward when [[AoA]] increases. And moves aft when AoA decreases.

#### CoP for symmetric airfoils
Stays at ~25% closer to leading edge.


### Aerofoil points
![[Pasted image 20220822213733.png]]
1. Stagnation point. (speed is zero, airflow divides into two flows ) Full stop -> [[Laminar boundary]]
2. Center of Pressure point. Max [[dynamic pressure]], Min static pressure
3. Transition point . [[Laminar boundary]] -> [[Turbulent boundary]]
4. Separation point. [[Turbulent boundary]] -> [[Stall]]
