[[PoF]]

## Stall
Default critical angle of attack is 16 degrees

The bigger weight -> the bigger stall speed. 
The bigger [[Wing loading]] -> the bigger stall speed

Better to have small stall speed. 

Increase when gears down
Decrease when we have full power

### Stall speed
$$V_snew = V_sold * \sqrt{\frac{Weight_{new}}{Weight_{old}}}$$

[[Load Factor]] can also change stall speed. The more [[Load Factor]] the more stall speed

$$V_snew = V_sold * \sqrt{LoadFactor} $$
