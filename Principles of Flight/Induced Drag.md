[[PoF]]

### Induced drag
Is one of four drags described in [[Drag]] note.

Produced by vortices on the wing tips. Vortex generated by spanwise air flow (perpendicular to wing).

On a straight wing airplane, all of the airflow over the wing travels parallel to the aircraft's chord line. But, **on a swept wing, only some of the air flows parallel to the chord line.** The other part flows perpendicular to the chord - this is called _spanwise flow._

Vortices produces [[Upwash]] before wing and [[Downwash]] behind the wind.

### Manoeuvring
During turn aircraft produces more lift. More lift generates begger vortices, bigger vortices generating more induced drag.
