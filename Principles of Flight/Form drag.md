[[PoF]]

Caused by the pressure of the aircraft acting on the frontal cross-sectional profile of the aircraft it moves.
Produced by the effect of viscosity on the pressure distribution around the object. Also known as pressure [[drag]]. Increases with increasing angle of attack.

Caused by the separation of the boundary layer from a surface and the wake created by that separation. It is primarily dependent upon the shape of the object.
