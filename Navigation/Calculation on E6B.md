WCA = TH - TC

## GS (Ground Speed) and WCA (Wind Correction Angle)

1. Set (rotate) wind direction
2. Draw dow in the middle center + wind velocity
3. Rotate to TC
4. Move dot to TAS (up/down)
5. GS is in the center now
6. Heading could be found as degrees as TC +- variation (wind correction angle)


## Wind vector and velocity

1. Set (rotate) TC (true cource)
2. Set GS to the center (up/down)
3. Cacl WCA = TH-TC
4. Draw dot of WCA on the line of TAS
5. Rotate dot to the centerline (middle)
6. Wind speed = dot value - center value
7. Wind direction is equal to current


## TC (True Course)

1. Set (rotate) wind direction
2. Set wind velocity (center plus velocity)
3. Set GS to the center (up/down) OR wind velocity dot to TAS 
4. Set TH (rotate)
5. Get WCA (variation to the right or left)
6. TC = TH - WCA
