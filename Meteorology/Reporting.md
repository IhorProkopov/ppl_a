## VOLMET

Met info for aircraft in flight. 
VOLMET reports are broadcast principally over high frequency (HF) radio by a number of civil and military stations located around the world. This global network is divided into regions with each region having a number of VOLMET broadcast stations which all broadcast on the same frequency(s). In some regions, such as Europe, there are also a number of stations which provide VOLMET broadcasts on very high frequency (VHF) radio. In both cases, the station will use automated voice transmission to broadcast TAF, SIGMET and Meteorological Terminal Air Report (METAR)
