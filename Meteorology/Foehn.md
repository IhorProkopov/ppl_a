A **Foehn** or **Föhn** is a type of dry, relatively warm, downslope wind that occurs in the lee ("Leeward") (downwind side) of a mountain range. It is a [rain shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow "Rain shadow") wind that results from the subsequent [adiabatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic "Adiabatic") warming of air that has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes (see [orographic lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lift "Orographic lift")). As a consequence of the different adiabatic [lapse rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate "Lapse rate") of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than equivalent elevations on the [windward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward "Windward") slopes.

Foehn winds can raise [temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") by as much as 14 °C (25 °F) in just a matter of hours. Switzerland, southern Germany and Austria have a warmer climate due to the Foehn, as moist winds off the Mediterranean Sea blow over the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps "Alps").

"Foehn" conditions usually develop with stability, widespread air blown against a mountain ridge.
