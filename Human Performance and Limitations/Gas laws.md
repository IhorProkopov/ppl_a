## Boyle's law

When presssure increases, the volume must decrease, and vice versa.

## Henry's law

The amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is directly proportional to its partial pressure.


## Dalton's law

States that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.

## Bohr equation

The Bohr equation is used to quantify the ratio of physiological dead space to the total tidal volume, and gives an indication of the extent of wasted ventilation.
