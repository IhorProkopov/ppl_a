Civil transponder has 3 modes:
- A - Coordinates + squawk code
- C - Altitude
- S - Additional info

### Mode A
When the transponder receives an interrogation request, it broadcasts the configured transponder code (or [[Squawk code]]). This is referred to as "Mode 3A" or more commonly, Mode A. A separate type of response called "Ident" can be initiated from the airplane by pressing a button on the transponder control panel.

### Mode C
A Mode A transponder code response can be augmented by a pressure altitude response, which is then referred to as Mode C operation Pressure altitude is obtained from an altitude encoder, either a separate self-contained unit mounted in the aircraft or an integral part of the transponder. The altitude information is passed to the transponder using a modified form of the modified [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code "Gray code") called a [Gillham code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillham_code "Gillham code").

Mode A and C responses are used to help air traffic controllers identify a particular aircraft's position and altitude on a radar screen, in order to maintain separation.


### Mode S
Another mode called Mode S (Select) is designed to help avoiding overinterrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are compatible with Mode A and Mode C Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) systems.
